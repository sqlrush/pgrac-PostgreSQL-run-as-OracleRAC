# 253_undo_tt_recovery.pl
#    spec-4.8 D0 — Undo/TT recovery gap-pin TAP (measure-first).
#
#    The durable undo/TT substrate is already crash-safe (spec-3.11 durable
#    TT slot + redo of XLOG_UNDO_TT_SLOT_COMMIT/ABORT + spec-4.5a cross-node
#    undo materialization).  spec-4.8 closes the RECOVERY-TIME "state verdict
#    + visibility closure" of undo/TT:
#      D1  crash-left TT_SLOT_ACTIVE -> ABORTED resolution ceremony
#      D2  cross-node TT authority (materialized & recovered_through gate),
#          no false-visible from a crashed peer's in-flight slot
#      D3  wrap-generation identity key (close task#90 raw-xid wrap residue)
#      D4  recycled-slot liveness relax (task#84, proof-gated)
#      D5  SCN high-watermark recovery (L222)
#      D7  minimal physical heap-tuple rollback apply (Q1, mini-plan-gated)
#
#    MEASURE-FIRST (L239, honest) — what reproduces against the shipped
#    spec-4.7 binary (a34c703739):
#
#    FINDING 1 (sig a, single-node correctness — PG-native already right):
#      With the spec-3.24 no-peer CR-gate fast path ON (the default), a
#      single node routes own-instance/session-local snapshots to PG-native
#      visibility.  A crash-left in-flight DELETE leaves the deleter
#      uncommitted (CLOG aborted-on-crash), so after restart the rows stay
#      VISIBLE -- correct.  The crash-left TT_SLOT_ACTIVE slot is merely
#      never RESOLVED to ABORTED (cluster_tt_durable.c:504 counts it as
#      stale_active_skipped, the by-xid resolver at :419 matches only
#      TT_SLOT_COMMITTED).  So on a single node this is a housekeeping +
#      cross-node-authority gap (D1/D2), NOT a single-node false-visible.
#
#    FINDING 2 (sig D5, L222 over-fail-closed — DETERMINISTIC RED):
#      With the fast path OFF (forcing the cluster CR/undo path, the regime
#      every CROSS-NODE read uses), a crash-restart makes the first CR read
#      fail "snapshot too old: CR cannot read undo record ... read_scn
#      predates the horizon".  cluster_scn is NOT recovered to the durable
#      pd_block_scn / commit_scn high-watermark on restart, so read_scn <
#      horizon -> CR tries to read recycled undo -> fail-closed (规则 8.A
#      compliant: error, not wrong data -- but OVER-fail-closed availability).
#      This is the L222 gap D5 closes; it is window-self-healing once SCN
#      advances past the peak.
#
#    FINDING 3 (observability — DETERMINISTIC RED):
#      No pg_cluster_state category 'tt_recovery' exists yet, so none of the
#      8 D1-D7 verdict counters are observable.  D6 flips this to PASS.
#
#    Signatures (b) cross-node materialized in-flight read and (c) wrap-
#    generation 2^32 residue are not harness-reproducible; they are unit-
#    proven (cluster_unit truth tables) and covered by the D2/D3 acceptance
#    legs once the resolution ceremony exists (L239).
