# 251_gcs_pcm_warm_recovery.pl
#    spec-4.7 D0 — GCS/PCM warm recovery gap-pin TAP (measure-first).
#
#    The block layer (PCM lock state machine spec-2.30+, GCS block
#    protocol spec-2.33-2.37) keeps ALL its coordination state in shmem
#    (GrdEntry: master_state / x_holder_node / s_holders_bitmap /
#    pi_watermark_lsn, cluster_pcm_lock.c).  A node death or a clean
#    restart loses that state with NO rebuild protocol, so warm recovery
#    of the block path is blocked today.
#
#    MEASURE-FIRST FINDING (recorded honestly — L77/L239).  Three gap
#    signatures were proposed (spec-4.7 §4.2):
#      (a) restart-rejected  "master rejected transition_id"
#      (b) dead-master       53R9K block-path-not-rebuilt
#      (c) retransmit budget 53R90
#    Running this test against the shipped spec-4.7a binary shows only (a)
#    reproduces deterministically e2e.  (b)/(c) are NOT reproducible with
#    the current harness primitives, for two independent reasons:
#      - hold-until-revoked (spec-4.7a, cluster.gcs_block_local_cache on):
#        a block held S/X stays cached locally after a peer master dies,
#        and cluster_pcm_mode_covers short-circuits the acquire BEFORE any
#        master lookup -> the dead-master guard is never reached.
#      - restart-resets-deadband: to clear a node's held state you restart
#        it, but a fresh restart resets CSSD death detection — the just-
#        restarted survivor optimistically sees the (actually dead) peer
#        as alive/connected (observed: cssd=alive ic=connected, HELLO sent
#        state CONNECTED), so cluster_cssd_get_peer_state(master) != DEAD
#        and the 53R9K guard does not fire.
#    The 53R9K guard (cluster_gcs_block.c:555) only fires in the narrow
#    window "not-held block AND survivor already converged on peer-DEAD
#    (not reset by a restart)", which needs controlled eviction or a
#    death-injection point that the current harness lacks.
#
#    Per the L239 re-scope (user 2026-06-13): this measure-first TAP pins
#    the deterministic gaps (a) + observability as XFAIL/RED; signatures
#    (b)/(c) are deferred to the D1-D5 acceptance legs, where the new
#    RECOVERING / redo-before-unfreeze state machine provides controllable
#    states (a block resource can be put into RECOVERING / before-redo-
#    boundary deterministically, which the raw 4.6 dead-master guard
#    cannot).  Their decision logic is proven at cluster_unit
#    (test_cluster_gcs_recovery, D1-D3).  spec-4.7 §4.2 / §7 DoD reconciled.
#
#    Topology (ClusterTriple, shared_data + 3 voting disks):
#      node0 owns the user relation and is the only holder of its blocks.
#      node1 / node2 are master-ONLY peers (never holders) for the ~2/3 of
#      warm_t's blocks the BufferTag hash masters away from node0.  node0's
#      single-node DML legitimately acquires S/X on peer-mastered blocks
#      (the peer grants as master; NO second holder, so NO spec-2.36
#      writer-transfer — healthy, confirmed by the L0 probe).  The
#      restart-rejected signature surfaces on the SAME blocks across a
#      holder restart with no live concurrent same-block contention
#      anywhere (L210: deterministic, no timing-window race asserted).
#      3 nodes (vs the pair) so the D1-D5 acceptance legs can later add the
#      cross-survivor / not-double-X (L7) scenarios on the same harness.
#
#    Leg map (D0 pins TODAY's broken behaviour;  D1-D6 flip / add legs,
#    spec-4.7 §4.2):
#      L0   strict triple (shared_data + 3 voting disks); node0 owns +
#           holds a GCS-tracked user table; healthy read+write probe ok.
#      L1   (sig a / D3 flip) node0 clean restart -> first re-access to a
#           previously-held peer-mastered block trips "master rejected
#           transition_id".  D3 flips: master_state rebuilt, access works.
#      L1b  (P1#3 / D1+D3 flip) two concurrent first re-accesses are both
#           unserved today (no idempotent lazy rebuild).  D1/D3 flip: one
#           idempotent rebuild serves both (block_state_rebuilt += 1).
#      L2/L3 (sig b/c) DEFERRED to D1-D5 acceptance + cluster_unit (L239,
#           see finding above).  SKIPed here with reason.
#      Lobs (D6/observability, FLIPPED) gcs_recovery dump category exposes the
#           8 warm-recovery counters under category='gcs_recovery'.
