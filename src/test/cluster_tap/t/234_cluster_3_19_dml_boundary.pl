# 234_cluster_3_19_dml_boundary.pl
#	  spec-3.19 D0 -- deterministic-ish reproducer for the pre-existing
#	  "attempted to update invisible tuple" cluster MVCC/DML boundary bug.
#
#	  Root-cause classification (D0, grep-confirmed against perf CI logs):
#	    The single-node perf baseline (cluster.cr_mvcc_gate defaults ON)
#	    crashes concurrent pgbench UPDATE with
#	        ERROR: attempted to update invisible tuple   (heapam.c:3905)
#	    while t/227 -- the SAME pgbench full-r/w workload but with
#	    cluster.cr_mvcc_gate = off -- stays clean.  So the disagreement is
#	    between the cluster CR MVCC scan short-circuit
#	    (cluster_cr_satisfies_mvcc: judges a tuple visible from the read_scn
#	    historical image) and HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate (single-node PG-native:
#	    rejects the live tuple as TM_Invisible).  It is a VERDICT
#	    DISAGREEMENT, not a CR-image-as-DML-target leak (the CR gate returns a
#	    bool; the executor mutates the live tuple).  See
#	    pgrac:specs/spec-3.19-...md §2.2 + docs/spec-3.19-visibility-verdict-audit.md.
#
#	  This file pins the differentiator as an executable gate:
#	    L1 (control)  cr_mvcc_gate = off  -> MUST stay clean (today: GREEN).
#	    L2 (repro)    cr_mvcc_gate = on   -> MUST stay clean (today: RED until
#	                  the D3 reconciliation fix; this is the spec-3.19 target).
#
#	  规則 8.A:  "attempted to update invisible tuple" is a hard PG guard
#	  against false-/wrong-version DML.  A RED L2 is a real correctness bug
#	  (the scan selected a tuple the update path cannot mutate) and blocks
#	  ship.
#
#	  Status: GREEN after the D3 fix (the CR-gate live-xmin guard in
#	  cluster_cr_satisfies_mvcc).  Locally this aborted at round 2-8 of an
#	  extreme-contention loop (S319_HOT_ROWS=2 S319_CLIENTS=16) before the fix
#	  and ran 40 clean rounds (200s) after.  L2's hard assertion is the
#	  regression sentinel; the retryable CR-reconstruct fail-closed is tolerated.
