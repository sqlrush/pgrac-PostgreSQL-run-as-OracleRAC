# 229_cluster_3_18_undo_writeback.pl
#    Stage 3.18 D2b — undo buffer write-back activation proof.
#
#    Runs the undo write path with cluster.undo_buffer_writeback = on, which
#    activates the full D2b machinery: 3-range delta WAL (FPI only on a block's
#    first touch since the last checkpoint), DELAY_CHKPT_START-wrapped emit,
#    deferred (write-back) pwrite, checkpoint write-back flush, and the removed
#    per-commit undo fsync.
#
#      L1   MVCC correctness with write-back: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE + CR reads
#           of pre-update versions resolve correctly (the pool serves the
#           buffered-dirty blocks).
#      L2   the delta path is actually exercised: pg_waldump shows both a
#           full-image and a 3-range-delta XLOG_UNDO_BLOCK_WRITE record.
#      L3   CHECKPOINT flushes the buffered-dirty undo blocks (no PANIC) and
#           data stays correct afterward.
#      L4   crash-restart redo (FPI + delta chain) reconstructs the undo, rows
#           intact, no PANIC.
#      L5   corrupt-old-bytes under write-back: damage a checkpoint-flushed
#           block's pre-checkpoint region, crash, restart -> the post-checkpoint
#           first-touch FPI restores the full block (the delta could not), rows
#           resolve.
