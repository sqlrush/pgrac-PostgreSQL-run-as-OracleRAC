# 004_backend_types.pl
#    Reverse-regression test for the BackendType enum extension (stage 0.10).
#
#    Stage 0.10 appends 14 pgrac process types to the PG-native BackendType
#    enum (docs/background-process-design.md §8.2) and adds 14 matching
#    cases to GetBackendTypeDesc() in miscinit.c.  Spawning paths for the
#    new processes do not land until stage 0.13+, so this test cannot
#    observe pgrac descriptor strings at runtime.
#
#    What this test actually proves:
#      - The extended switch in GetBackendTypeDesc() still returns correct
#        strings for the 14 PG-native enum values (no accidental fallthrough
#        from added cases).
#      - pg_stat_activity.backend_type returns expected PG-native values
#        for currently active backends.
#      - The server starts cleanly with the extended enum compiled in.
#
#    The 14 new descriptor strings ("lms worker", "undo cleaner", ...)
#    will be verified directly via ps and pg_stat_activity in stage 0.13+
#    once the corresponding fork() paths are in place.
