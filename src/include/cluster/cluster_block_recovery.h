 * cluster_block_recovery.h
 *	  pgrac online single-block recovery orchestrator (spec-4.10 D2+).
 *
 *	  Online block recovery reconstructs one corrupt / lost-write block from
 *	  WAL -- on a detached page, in a backend, outside PG's startup redo loop
 *	  -- instead of a full-database PANIC.  This header declares the
 *	  reconstruction primitive; the detection trigger (D1), the recovering-set
 *	  access gate + online install (D4), and cross-node coordination (D5) build
 *	  on top of it.
 *
 *	  cluster_block_recovery_reconstruct() is the D2 BOUNDED reconstructor: the
 *	  caller supplies an explicit WAL window [scan_lower, scan_upper]; the
 *	  function scans this node's OWN WAL stream in that window, rebuilds the
 *	  block to its last own-thread version <= scan_upper, and writes it to the
 *	  caller's page only on success.  It fails closed (UNRECOVERABLE) on any
 *	  uncertainty (no full-page-image base found, an unsupported delta, or a
 *	  header-insane result) -- it never returns a possibly-wrong page (8.A).
 *
 *	  DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE here (caller / later deliverables):
 *	    - WHERE [scan_lower, scan_upper] come from (oldest-WAL / checkpoint /
 *	      PI watermark): the caller derives them (D1/D2 trigger).
 *	    - The own-thread *gate against a foreign last-writer*: this reads only
 *	      the local stream, so it is correct for single-node / single-writer
 *	      blocks; a block whose latest version (<= scan_upper) lives in a peer
 *	      thread would reconstruct to a STALE own-thread version.  The
 *	      authoritative cross-thread target check that fails such cases closed
 *	      is D5 (merged WAL / PI watermark).  Callers MUST guarantee the
 *	      own-thread precondition until then.

 *	Gated: cluster.online_block_recovery on, NOT during startup recovery, and
 *	SINGLE-NODE only (cluster_conf_has_peers() -> false; a multi-node block may
 *	have a foreign last-writer that the own-thread reconstruct would rebuild
 *	stale -> forward Stage 5, D5).  Derives the scan window (oldest available
 *	WAL .. flush LSN) and calls cluster_block_recovery_reconstruct.
 *
 *	On success the rebuilt page is left in `buffer` AND written back to disk
 *	(D4 durable install): the version is own-thread (pd_lsn <= flush), so the
 *	WAL it depends on is already durable -- XLogFlush is a no-op, no new WAL is
 *	produced, and a crash/torn write simply leaves the block corrupt for the
 *	next read to re-recover (idempotent).  Returns true iff the block was
 *	rebuilt (caller treats the read as verified); false otherwise (caller
 *	falls back to its zero/error policy).  Never installs a possibly-wrong
 *	block (8.A): any uncertainty -> false.
 *
 *	The recovering-set / cross-path access gate the spec sketches for D4 is
 *	subsumed here by the buffer manager's in-progress I/O (concurrent readers
 *	of the same block wait, never see the corrupt/half-rebuilt page); the
 *	explicit recovering-set + 53R9L retry is built when its real consumer
