 * cluster_undo_retention.h
 *	  pgrac own-instance undo / TT-slot retention horizon (spec-3.12).
 *
 *	  The retention horizon is the min CLUSTER-source read_scn over all
 *	  backends' live snapshots (each backend publishes its per-backend min into
 *	  PGPROC->cluster_read_scn_atomic via snapmgr; spec-3.12 D1).  TT slots and
 *	  undo segments whose commit_scn is strictly below the horizon are needed by
 *	  no live reader and may be recycled; commit_scn >= horizon is retained.
 *	  This retires the spec-3.11 L4 watermark fail-closed + D5 old-slot
 *	  fail-closed (durable TT slot kept alive while a reader needs it).
 *
 *	  Implementation note: cluster_undo_retention_horizon() lives in
 *	  procarray.c (it scans the ProcArray under ProcArrayLock, mirroring
 *	  GetOldestXmin); the recyclable predicates (spec-3.12 D2/D3) are pure and
 *	  cluster_unit-tested.  Callers must compute the horizon BEFORE taking
 *	  seg->lock / undo lifecycle_lock (spec-3.12 C17 lock ordering).

 *	cluster_tt_slot_recyclable:
 *	  Given a TT-slot allocator status (ClusterTTSlotAllocStatus value), its
 *	  commit_scn, and the current horizon, decide whether the slot may be
 *	  recycled.  ABORTED -> always (C7); COMMITTED -> only when
 *	  commit_scn < horizon (strict; a reader at read_scn == commit_scn still
 *	  needs the pre-image).  InvalidScn horizon (cluster disabled) -> the gate
 *	  carries no constraint, so COMMITTED is recyclable.  A COMMITTED slot with
 *	  an unresolved (InvalidScn) commit_scn is retained (rule 8.A fail-closed).
 *
 *	cluster_undo_segment_recyclable:
 *	  An undo segment may be recycled only when it is SEGMENT_COMMITTED AND its
 *	  retention watermark (= max commit_scn over the header's COMMITTED TT
 *	  slots) is strictly below the horizon.  ACTIVE / ALLOCATED / FULL-but-
 *	  ACTIVE are never recyclable (C5), even when they carry no COMMITTED slot.
 *	  A SEGMENT_COMMITTED segment with no live COMMITTED slot is recyclable; one
 *	  carrying a COMMITTED slot with an unresolved commit_scn is retained
 *	  (rule 8.A fail-closed).
