 * cluster_buffer_desc.h
 *	  pgrac cluster buffer descriptor cluster fields typedefs +
 *	  invariants.
 *
 *	  Stage 1.6 ships only the enums + INVALID_BUFFER_ID / INVALID_NODE_ID
 *	  sentinels.  All cluster fields on every BufferDesc are written to
 *	  placeholder values at InitBufferPool / InitLocalBuffers time
 *	  (via ClusterInitBufferDescFields, defined in buf_internals.h
 *	  after the BufferDesc struct) and remain in those placeholder
 *	  states for the duration of stage 1.6; the actual PCM lock state
 *	  machine (AD-002), CR chain construction (AD-006), PI buffer
 *	  creation (#84), Cache Fusion protocol (#17), and GRD master
 *	  cache (#11/#12) all land at Stage 2-3 真值激活 spec.
 *
 *	  Each BufferDesc in pgrac 1.6+ contains ~76B of cluster fields:
 *	    - 12B hot tail in 64B BufferDesc segment 1 ([52, 64); buffer_type / pcm_state
 *	      / pi_flags / cluster_padding_1 / block_scn).
 *	    - 64B cold body in 64B BufferDesc segment 2 ([64, 128); cr_chain_head /
 *	      cr_chain_next / cr_scn / pi_buf_id / pi_lsn / grd_master_node
 *	      / grd_master_seq / cf_state / cf_owner_node / cf_request_count
 *	      / pcm_lock / pi_created_at).
 *	  packed into the BufferDescPadded slot whose padded size grew from
 *	  PG-vanilla 64B to pgrac 128B (BUFFERDESC_PAD_TO_SIZE 64 -> 128 in
 *	  USE_PGRAC_CLUSTER mode -- see buf_internals.h).  PG-original
 *	  fields occupy [0, 52) on PG 16.13 (BufferTag 20B + buf_id 4B +
 *	  state 4B + wait_backend 4B + freeNext 4B + content_lock 16B); the
 *	  cluster hot tail fits in the remaining 12B of 64B BufferDesc segment 1 so
 *	  existing PG hot paths still read 1 cache line.  block_scn is the
 *	  Stage 2-3 visibility hot field and stays in 64B BufferDesc segment 1 by
 *	  design (PIVOT B 2026-05-02 user approve); cr_chain_head is cold
 *	  (CR construction path only) and lives at the 64B BufferDesc segment 2
 *	  boundary.
 *
 *	  Critical layout invariant (Q2 + Q7 audit + PIVOT B):
 *	    PG bufmgr.c:AssertNotCatalogBufferLock reverse-derefs BufferDesc
 *	    from an LWLock pointer using
 *	      bufHdr = (BufferDesc *) ((char *) lock - offsetof(BufferDesc,
 *	                                                       content_lock))
 *	    which uses the offsetof() macro and therefore adapts to whatever
 *	    PG version's actual content_lock offset is (36 on PG 16.13).
 *	    The Q2 invariant is that cluster fields appear *after*
 *	    content_lock so the reverse-deref keeps yielding a valid
 *	    BufferDesc pointer.  StaticAssertDecls in buf_internals.h
 *	    enforce this semantically (block_scn stays in 64B BufferDesc segment 1;
 *	    cr_chain_head starts 64B BufferDesc segment 2; cluster fields follow
 *	    content_lock).  Any future reorder breaking these semantics
 *	    fails to compile.
 *
 *	  Critical local buffer note (Q1 §1.4 + Q7 audit):
 *	    PG localbuf.c:595 calls
 *	      LocalBufferDescriptors = (BufferDesc *) calloc(nbufs, sizeof(BufferDesc))
 *	    which zero-fills.  Most cluster fields' placeholder values are
 *	    legitimately 0 (PCM_STATE_N / BUF_TYPE_CURRENT / CF_STATE_NONE
 *	    / InvalidScn / etc.), but cr_chain_head / cr_chain_next /
 *	    pi_buf_id MUST be -1 (INVALID_BUFFER_ID); 0 is a *valid*
 *	    buffer_id and would mislead Stage 3 CR-path reads of local
 *	    buffers.  pcm_lock also MUST be LWLockInitialize'd explicitly --
 *	    calloc 0 is not a valid LWLock state.  This is why
 *	    ClusterInitBufferDescFields() exists and is called from BOTH
 *	    InitBufferPool() and InitLocalBuffers() (PGRAC MODIFICATIONS
 *	    14th and 16th respectively).
