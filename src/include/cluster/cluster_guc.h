 *
 * cluster_guc.h
 *	  pgrac cluster GUC registration entry point and exported variables.
 *
 *	  This header is the single source of truth for cluster GUC C
 *	  declarations.  Stage 0.13 introduces the registration mechanism
 *	  and activates the first cluster GUC, cluster_node_id (originally
 *	  a placeholder global in cluster_elog.c, see spec-0.9).  Future
 *	  cluster GUCs land here at the same time their owning subsystem
 *	  spec is implemented; see docs/cluster-guc-design.md §3.1 for the
 *	  Single Source of Truth registration roster.
 *
 *	  Responsibilities of this header:
 *
 *	  - Declare extern storage for every registered cluster GUC C
 *	    variable, so the rest of the cluster code can read its current
 *	    value without going through the SQL GUC layer.
 *	  - Declare cluster_init_guc(), the registration entry point that
 *	    PostmasterMain calls (under #ifdef USE_PGRAC_CLUSTER) right after
 *	    PG's built-in GUCs are loaded.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.13 does NOT register the ~24 cluster GUCs listed in the
 *	  background-process / error-codes design docs.  Each remaining
 *	  GUC is registered together with the spec that introduces its
 *	  first reader (CLAUDE.md rule 8).  That policy is documented in
 *	  docs/cluster-guc-design.md §1 and §7.
