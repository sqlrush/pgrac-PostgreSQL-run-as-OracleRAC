 *
 * cluster_undo_extent.h
 *	  pgrac spec-3.18 D3 — per-transaction undo extent partitioning (interface).
 *
 *	  D3 kills the single per-instance cursor_lock serial hot-spot: instead of
 *	  every backend advancing one shared cursor (active_segment_id /
 *	  current_block / free_offset / slot_count) under cursor_lock for EVERY
 *	  undo record, a backend CLAIMS an extent -- a run of N consecutive data
 *	  blocks (GUC cluster.undo_extent_blocks, default 4) -- and then advances a
 *	  BACKEND-LOCAL cursor within it.  Only an extent claim touches the shared
 *	  lifecycle lock + the shared high-water mark;  per-record writes are
 *	  lock-free w.r.t. other backends (the blocks of an extent are private to
 *	  the claiming backend, and per-block content is still protected by the D1
 *	  undo buffer pool's content_lock).
 *
 *	  Recycling granularity is UNCHANGED (whole-segment, spec-3.12/3.13):
 *	  extents only partition WRITE-TIME block allocation within the active
 *	  segment.  When a segment is recycled/reborn its blocks (former extents)
 *	  are reused wholesale, gated on the segment's TT slots being recyclable
 *	  (existing gate) -- so retention contracts C1/C5 hold (spec §3.5).  A
 *	  backend that claims an extent then crashes leaves those blocks unused
 *	  until the whole segment recycles;  no permanent leak (the high-water
 *	  advance is atomic under lifecycle_lock).
 *
 *	  UBA / undo chain / 64B UndoRecordHeader are unchanged: block_no in the
 *	  UBA now comes from the backend-local extent cursor instead of the shared
 *	  cursor.
