 *
 * cluster_conf.h
 *	  pgrac cluster topology configuration (Stage 0.19).
 *
 *	  This header declares the in-memory representation of the cluster
 *	  topology -- the list of nodes that make up the cluster -- and the
 *	  loader / accessor API.  Source of truth at startup is the
 *	  pgrac.conf file (path from cluster.config_file GUC); the loader
 *	  parses it once and writes the result into the shmem-backed
 *	  ClusterConfShmem control block, which all backends share.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.19 is the framework only: it ships a parser that handles
 *	  the file when present, falls back to a single-node degraded
 *	  topology when absent (so existing single-node tests keep
 *	  passing), and exposes the result via the pg_cluster_nodes SQL
 *	  view.  Real readers -- Interconnect / Heartbeat / Reconfig /
 *	  Recovery Coordinator / GES master selection -- arrive in
 *	  Stage 2+ and consume ClusterConfShmem unchanged.
 *
 *	  See docs/cluster-conf-design.md for the full design rationale and
 *	  Stage evolution path; specs/spec-0.19-conf-framework.md for the
 *	  stage-0 scope and exit criteria.

 *	  (pg_proc.dat references it from both build modes; see the body
