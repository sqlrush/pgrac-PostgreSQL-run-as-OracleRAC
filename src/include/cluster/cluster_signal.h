 *
 * cluster_signal.h
 *	  pgrac cluster signal handlers and per-process pending flags.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.15 introduces the cluster procsignal extension: PG's
 *	  SIGUSR1 / ProcSignal multiplexer is extended with cluster-specific
 *	  ProcSignalReason values (currently just PROCSIG_CLUSTER_RECONFIG_START),
 *	  and this header declares the matching async-signal-safe handlers
 *	  plus the volatile pending flags they set.
 *
 *	  Why SIGUSR1 (not SIGUSR2):
 *
 *	  The original roadmap entry mentioned "SIGUSR2 cluster 信号" but PG
 *	  already assigns process-specific meanings to SIGUSR2 (walwriter
 *	  wake, archiver wake, autovac launcher wake, postmaster status
 *	  signal, ...).  Multiplexing through SIGUSR2 would conflict with
 *	  those meanings.  PG's only public extension point is SIGUSR1 +
 *	  ProcSignalReason, the same mechanism PG uses internally for
 *	  PROCSIG_RECOVERY_CONFLICT_*.  See docs/cluster-signal-design.md §1.
 *
 *	  Handler contract (CLAUDE.md rule 16):
 *
 *	  - handlers run in signal context; they MUST be async-signal-safe
 *	  - allowed: write volatile sig_atomic_t flags, SetLatch(MyLatch)
 *	  - forbidden: palloc, elog, LWLock, anything calling ProcessInterrupts
 *
 *	  Real processing happens later (typically in CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS
 *	  driven Process<X>Interrupt() functions); stage 0.15 only sets
 *	  the flag.  The first reader / consumer of these flags lands in
 *	  Stage 2.X LMON spec.

 *
