 * cluster_quorum_decision.h
 *	  Pure-logic majority view + collision detection — spec-2.6 D4.
 *
 *	  Step 2 D4.  Stateless function family that takes a per-(disk,
 *	  node) slot matrix collected by Step 2 D3 cluster_voting_disk_io
 *	  and returns a ClusterQuorumDecision struct holding:
 *	    - quorum_state (OK / UNCERTAIN / LOST)
 *	    - alive_bitmap (per-instance alive view)
 *	    - epoch_max (largest current_epoch observed across alive slots —
 *	      used by boot-time epoch recovery per spec-2.0 §3 R10)
 *	    - collision_state (Q6 v0.2 newer-self-FATAL flag)
 *
 *	  Functions in this header are PURE — no shmem, no I/O, no logging,
 *	  no GUC reads.  Callers (cluster_qvotec poll cycle) are responsible
 *	  for collecting the slot matrix, invoking decide_quorum_view, and
 *	  acting on the returned ClusterQuorumDecision.
 *
 *	  Q4 v0.2 lease semantics live in cluster_qvotec.c (writes the
 *	  decision into shmem with lease_expire_at_us);this module just
 *	  computes the decision.
 *
 *	  Q6 v0.2 collision direction:
 *	    - self.incarnation > slot.incarnation → newer-self-FATAL
 *	      (let the older serving instance keep its in-progress
 *	      transactions / cached buffers)
 *	    - self.incarnation < slot.incarnation → OBSERVED_OLDER
 *	      (the other instance is the newer comer and should self-
 *	      FATAL on its own quorum poll;we continue;UNCERTAIN until
 *	      the other side exits)
 *	    - self.incarnation == slot.incarnation → NONE (no collision)

/*
 * decide_quorum_view — pure majority decision.
 *
 *	Inputs:
 *	  slots[N_disks][N_max_nodes]  — slot matrix from
 *	    cluster_voting_disk_io.read_slot per (disk, node) pair
 *	  io_states[N_disks]           — per-disk I/O outcome from
 *	    most-recent read_all_disks pass (per Q2 v0.2 anything not OK
 *	    means this disk's column data is untrusted this cycle)
 *	  N_disks                      — total voting disk count
 *	  self_node_id                 — caller's node_id (for collision
 *	    detection)
 *	  self_incarnation             — caller's boot incarnation
 *	  now_us                       — wall-clock at decision time
 *	    (caller passes GetCurrentTimestamp() result)
 *	  heartbeat_timeout_us         — slot is "fresh" iff
 *	    now_us - slot.heartbeat_ts_us <= this.  Stale slots (e.g. a
 *	    crashed instance left ALIVE with stale heartbeat_ts_us) are
 *	    EXCLUDED from alive_bitmap and from collision detection.  Pass
 *	    0 to opt out of freshness gating (epoch recovery / fsck tools).
 *
 *	Output:
 *	  *out  populated;return code = quorum_state shortcut for callers
 *	  who don't care about the rest of the struct.
 *
 *	Behavior:
 *	  - disks_ok_count = count of io_states == OK
 *	  - disks_total_count = N_disks
 *	  - quorum_state:
 *	      OK         if disks_ok_count >= (N_disks/2) + 1
 *	      LOST       if disks_ok_count == 0
 *	      UNCERTAIN  otherwise (>0 but < majority)
 *	  - epoch_max = max(slot.current_epoch) across ALL OK-disk slots
 *	    with generation > 0 (epoch recovery reads STALE slots too;
 *	    a crashed instance's epoch is still valid input to
 *	    "boot epoch = max + 1" per spec-2.0 §3 R10)
 *	  - alive_bitmap: bit set for every node_id where ANY OK disk has
 *	    a FRESH (heartbeat_ts_us within timeout window) slot with
 *	    generation > 0 + flags.alive set.  Stale slots NOT counted —
 *	    a crashed peer's leftover ALIVE slot does not pollute the view.
 *	  - collision_state per Q6 v0.2 — scan FRESH ALIVE OK-disk slots
 *	    only for slot.node_id == self_node_id with different incarnation;
 *	    stale collisions ignored (the other side has died);non-ALIVE
 *	    slots are clean-shutdown tombstones and do not collide.
