 * cluster_ges_reply_wait.h
 *	  Cross-node GES reply wait table — spec-2.23 D1.
 *
 *	  Backend-side reply correlation HTAB for the cross-node GES grant
 *	  pipeline.  When cluster_ges_send_request_and_wait() (spec-2.23 D2)
 *	  ships a GES_REQUEST to a remote master, it inserts an entry into
 *	  this HTAB keyed by a 5-tuple, then blocks on the entry's
 *	  ConditionVariable.  The reply handler looks up by the same 5-tuple
 *	  and wakes the entry.  Timeout sweep deletes stale entries before
 *	  the request_id slot is reused, so a late reply finds no matching
 *	  entry and is silently dropped (counter++).
 *
 *	  HC17 invariant (spec-2.23 §3.2):
 *	    - Key is 5-tuple {request_id, source_node_id, dest_node_id,
 *	      request_opcode, cluster_epoch}.
 *	    - request_opcode discriminates REQUEST vs RELEASE replies that
 *	      may share the same request_id slot.
 *	    - cluster_epoch guards reconfig races (post-reconfig peers must
 *	      not satisfy a wait posted before the epoch advance).
 *	    - On timeout, the wait entry is unconditionally deleted by the
 *	      caller before the request_id slot can be recycled.
 *	    - Late reply (lookup miss) is silently dropped + late-drop
 *	      counter++.  No ereport — handler context cannot ERROR.
 *
 *	  Skeleton phase (spec-2.23 Step 1 D1):  shmem region, HTAB, key /
 *	  entry struct, public API surface.  The send-side and reply-side
 *	  CV wait/wake loops land Step 2 D2 (alongside cluster_unit
 *	  T-reply-1..6).
 *
 *	  Spec: spec-2.23-cross-node-ges-bast-deadlock-production.md (FROZEN v0.3)
 *	  Design: docs/ges-lock-protocol-design.md v1.0
