 * cluster_visibility_resolve.h
 *	  pgrac single tuple-xid cluster status resolver (spec-3.14 D1).
 *
 *	  spec-3.2/3.3 wired the cluster visibility fork into
 *	  HeapTupleSatisfiesMVCC only.  spec-3.14 extends the remaining
 *	  HeapTupleSatisfies* variants (Update / Dirty / Self / Toast) and
 *	  the prune/vacuum guards.  To avoid five divergent copies of the
 *	  "ITL ref -> exact key -> TT overlay lookup -> SUBCOMMITTED follow"
 *	  logic (L212 anti-divergence), that evidence/status resolution is
 *	  extracted here as ONE pure-ish resolver.  Each variant keeps its
 *	  OWN visibility policy (truth table); this file only answers
 *	  "what is the authoritative cluster status of this tuple-side xid,
 *	  and is the evidence local / remote / stale?".
 *
 *	  The resolver performs NO visibility-policy ereport: UNKNOWN /
 *	  STALE_OR_AMBIGUOUS are returned as evidence/status for the caller
 *	  to fail-closed per its own table (53R97).  Genuinely corrupt
 *	  metadata (malformed UBA) still raises DATA_CORRUPTED via the
 *	  underlying helpers, as today.
 *
 *	  Exact-key discipline (spec-3.14 v0.2, R10 refined): an ITL slot
 *	  ref is authoritative remote evidence only when ref.tt_slot_id != 0,
 *	  ref.origin_node_id != self, and ref.local_xid == raw_xid.  A remote
 *	  slot whose recorded xid no longer matches the tuple-side xid was
 *	  recycled to another owner -> STALE_OR_AMBIGUOUS -> caller 53R97;
 *	  NEVER silently fall through to the PG-native CLOG path for remote
 *	  evidence.  Own-instance refs are LOCAL and always route to PG-native
 *	  CLOG, including the normal local hot-page case where the 8-slot ITL
 *	  cache has recycled the tuple's old slot.
