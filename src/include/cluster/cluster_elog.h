 *
 * cluster_elog.h
 *	  pgrac cluster logging context wrapper around PostgreSQL's elog().
 *
 *	  This header defines CLUSTER_LOG -- a thin wrapper that prepends
 *	  cluster context (node id, lifecycle phase) to every log line
 *	  emitted by the cluster subsystem.  Output format:
 *
 *	      [cluster node=<N> phase=<S>] <user message>
 *
 *	  Stage 0.9 ships placeholder values:
 *	      cluster_node_id = -1   (will become a GUC in stage 0.13+)
 *	      cluster_phase   = "init" (writer manually transitions)
 *
 *	  Stage 0.13+ will wire cluster_node_id to the cluster_node_id GUC
 *	  and cluster_phase to the postmaster startup phase machine.
 *
 *	  Conventions (CLAUDE.md rule 17):
 *	    DEBUG5..DEBUG1   - tracing, default off
 *	    LOG              - server log only
 *	    INFO/NOTICE      - user-facing
 *	    WARNING          - operation continues, attention warranted
 *	    ERROR            - aborts the current transaction
 *	    FATAL            - terminates the connection
 *	    PANIC            - kills the postmaster
 *
 *	  Use CLUSTER_LOG for cluster-internal lifecycle events.  For
 *	  end-user-facing errors that need a SQLSTATE code, use ereport()
 *	  directly until CLUSTER_REPORT lands in stage 0.12 (paired with
 *	  the SQLSTATE registration framework).

 *	Wrapper around PG's elog(); accepts the same format/args as elog.
 *
 *	Format prepended:
 *	  "[cluster node=<id> phase=<phase>] "
 *
 *	Examples:
 *	  CLUSTER_LOG(DEBUG1, "starting LMS worker %d", worker_id);
 *	  CLUSTER_LOG(LOG, "GRD rebuild complete in %d ms", elapsed);
 *
 *	Implementation: a function-like macro that splices a prefix into
