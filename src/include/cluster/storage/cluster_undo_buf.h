 * cluster_undo_buf.h
 *	  pgrac spec-3.18 D1 — per-instance undo block buffer pool (interface).
 *
 *	  AD-014 (undo durability/cache form) restores the 专项 #3 §17.3 form:
 *	  active undo blocks live in an in-memory pool, not direct-written per
 *	  record.  This header declares the pool API locked by
 *	  pgrac:docs/spec-3.18-d1d2-interface-lock.md (v1.1).
 *
 *	  D1/D2 SCOPE (interface-lock §3, then D2b):
 *	    - with cluster.undo_buffer_writeback off, this is a read-through cache
 *	      with write-through pwrite(do_fsync=false); fsync stays at the legacy
 *	      precommit path, not per-unpin.
 *	    - with cluster.undo_buffer_writeback on, dirty DATA blocks are protected
 *	      by XLOG_UNDO_BLOCK_WRITE and flushed by checkpoint / eviction.  The
 *	      runtime latch in cluster_undo_buf_writeback_allowed() disables this
 *	      path while peers exist;  the GUC check hook only warns.
 *	    - DATA blocks only (block_no >= 1) are poolable;  block 0 (segment
 *	      header + durable TT slots, modified via byte-targeted
 *	      cluster_undo_smgr_{read,write}_header_bytes) is NOT pooled — pooling
 *	      it would go stale vs the header-byte path (interface-lock §3 pt 4).
 *
 *	  Pin discipline (interface-lock §2, review pt 1/2):  the content-lock
 *	  mode is chosen AT PIN TIME — there is no SHARED->EXCLUSIVE in-place
 *	  upgrade (LWLock upgrade self-deadlocks).  Write order is
 *	    pin(EXCLUSIVE) -> mutate image -> XLogInsert -> mark_dirty(lsn) -> unpin.
