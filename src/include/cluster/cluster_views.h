 *
 * cluster_views.h
 *	  pgrac cluster system view backing functions (SRF declarations).
 *
 *	  Stage 0.16 introduces the cluster pg_stat_cluster_* view registration
 *	  framework.  Each view is backed by a Set-Returning Function declared
 *	  here and implemented in src/backend/cluster/cluster_views.c.  The
 *	  matching pg_proc.dat entries register the SRFs with PG's catalog,
 *	  and src/backend/catalog/system_views.sql declares the SQL views
 *	  on top of them.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.16 ships ONE view: pg_stat_cluster_wait_events, exposing
 *	  the 46 cluster wait events registered by spec-0.11.  Future views
 *	  (pg_stat_cluster_nodes, pg_stat_cluster_ges_locks, ...) land here
 *	  together with their owning subsystem spec, per the registration
 *	  policy in docs/cluster-views-impl-design.md.
 *
 *	  PG calls these SRFs through fmgr; this header therefore provides
 *	  only the C symbol declarations needed by cluster_views.c itself
 *	  and by unit tests.  The fmgr glue is generated automatically by
 *	  PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1() in cluster_views.c.
