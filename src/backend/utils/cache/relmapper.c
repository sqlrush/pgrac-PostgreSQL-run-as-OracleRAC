 * relmapper.c
 *	  Catalog-to-filenumber mapping
 *
 * For most tables, the physical file underlying the table is specified by
 * pg_class.relfilenode.  However, that obviously won't work for pg_class
 * itself, nor for the other "nailed" catalogs for which we have to be able
 * to set up working Relation entries without access to pg_class.  It also
 * does not work for shared catalogs, since there is no practical way to
 * update other databases' pg_class entries when relocating a shared catalog.
 * Therefore, for these special catalogs (henceforth referred to as "mapped
 * catalogs") we rely on a separately maintained file that shows the mapping
 * from catalog OIDs to filenumbers.  Each database has a map file for
 * its local mapped catalogs, and there is a separate map file for shared
 * catalogs.  Mapped catalogs have zero in their pg_class.relfilenode entries.
 *
 * Relocation of a normal table is committed (ie, the new physical file becomes
 * authoritative) when the pg_class row update commits.  For mapped catalogs,
 * the act of updating the map file is effectively commit of the relocation.
 * We postpone the file update till just before commit of the transaction
 * doing the rewrite, but there is necessarily a window between.  Therefore
 * mapped catalogs can only be relocated by operations such as VACUUM FULL
 * and CLUSTER, which make no transactionally-significant changes: it must be
 * safe for the new file to replace the old, even if the transaction itself
 * aborts.  An important factor here is that the indexes and toast table of
 * a mapped catalog must also be mapped, so that the rewrites/relocations of
 * all these files commit in a single map file update rather than being tied
 * to transaction commit.

/*
 * ============================================================
 * PGRAC MODIFICATIONS
 *
 * Modified by: SqlRush <sqlrush@gmail.com>
 *
 * What changed:
 *   - Added a single hook call inside write_relmap_file() (the
 *     SOURCE side, alongside CacheInvalidateRelmap()) to mirror
 *     relation-map updates across cluster instances.  The hook body
 *     itself is a stub at Stage 2.7 (only bumps the cross-instance
 *     broadcast STUB counter); spec-2.27 SI Broadcaster will turn
 *     it into a real wire send.
 *
 *   - History note: Hardening v1.0.0 (2026-05-09 pre-ship F3) moved
 *     the hook from RelationMapInvalidate() (the sinval RECEIVE
 *     callback) to write_relmap_file() source side to avoid
 *     cross-instance re-broadcast amplification when peers receive
 *     a relmap inval and run the local reload callback.  Hardening
 *     v1.0.1 (2026-05-09 post-ship F4) refreshed this header text
 *     after v1.0.0 amend — earlier copy still said
 *     "inside RelationMapInvalidate()" by mistake.
 *
 * Why:
 *   - PG sinval is process-local on its own.  When two cluster
 *     instances each have a backend with shared / per-database map
 *     files cached, the local RelationMapInvalidate path only
 *     reloads the calling backend's copy.  spec-2.7 §2.4 wires the
 *     boundary now so that spec-2.27 can flip the stub to real
 *     without touching this PG-original file again (per AD-001
 *     Option C "wire boundaries early, activate late" pattern).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — critical section forward-contract (Hardening v1.0.1 F2 / L93):
 *   write_relmap_file() enters START_CRIT_SECTION() at line ~1012;
 *   the hook call sits inside that critical section (line ~1048,
 *   right after CacheInvalidateRelmap()).  The current stub body
 *   is nofail (atomic counter add only) — safe inside crit section.
 *   spec-2.27 ACTIVATION CONSTRAINT: hook body must remain
 *   nofail/nonblocking inside START_CRIT_SECTION;the actual SI
 *   Broadcaster send + peer ack MUST happen outside the critical
 *   section (post-commit callback / aux process drain shmem queue).
 *   ANY ereport(ERROR) / palloc-failure / wait inside crit section
 *   is upgraded to PANIC by PG core (CLAUDE.md rule 16).  spec-2.27
 *   drafter MUST design queue+drain pattern, not "just change hook
 *   body to call SI Broadcaster directly".
 *
 * Spec: spec-2.7-smgr-cluster-2node-concurrent-open.md (v0.2 frozen
 *       2026-05-09;Q2 v0.2 `bool shared` sig + Hardening v1.0.0 F3
 *       source-side relocation + Hardening v1.0.1 F4 stale text fix
 *       + L93 critical-section-hook-must-nofail-enqueue forward-contract).
