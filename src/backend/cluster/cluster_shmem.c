 *
 * cluster_shmem.c
 *	  pgrac cluster shared-memory registration and control block.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.14 establishes the cluster shmem framework.  All cluster
 *	  subsystems funnel through this file's two public entry points:
 *
 *	    cluster_request_shmem()  -- Phase 1 (miscinit.c)
 *	      Reserves the size of every cluster shmem region by calling
 *	      RequestAddinShmemSpace() and (when needed) RequestNamedLWLock-
 *	      Tranche().  Subsystems append their own *_shmem_request()
 *	      static helpers below.
 *
 *	    cluster_init_shmem()     -- Phase 2 (ipci.c)
 *	      Allocates each region via ShmemInitStruct() and runs first-
 *	      time initialisation when ShmemInitStruct returns found = false.
 *	      Subsystems append their own *_shmem_init() static helpers.
 *
 *	  Why one entry per subsystem instead of letting each subsystem edit
 *	  PG core files directly: keeps the PGRAC MODIFICATIONS to PG paths
 *	  to the two single-line callbacks at the top of this file -- new
 *	  cluster subsystems never touch miscinit.c or ipci.c again.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.14 ships only the control block (ClusterShmemCtl).  See
 *	  docs/cluster-shmem-design.md §3 for the full registration roster
 *	  and CLAUDE.md rule 8 for why we do not pre-allocate placeholder
 *	  regions or LWLocks.
