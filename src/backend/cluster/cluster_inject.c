 * cluster_inject.c
 *	  pgrac cluster error-injection framework (Stage 0.27).
 *
 *	  Implements:
 *	    - The compile-time injection-point registry (six points covering
 *	      cluster_init_shmem / cluster_ic_init / cluster_conf_load).
 *	    - cluster_injection_run -- look up the named entry, dispatch the
 *	      armed fault type, increment the lifetime hit counter.
 *	    - Five fault dispatchers (ERROR / WARNING / SLEEP / CRASH / SKIP);
 *	      NONE is the implicit "counter only" path.
 *	    - Two SRFs (cluster_inject_fault / cluster_get_injection_state)
 *	      backing pg_stat_cluster_injections.
 *	    - The GUC startup-arm path: cluster.injection_points lists names
 *	      that should be auto-armed to fault_type=WARNING at backend
 *	      startup (counter + warn).  Wired via the GUC's assign_hook so
 *	      that postgresql.conf changes take effect on the next reload.
