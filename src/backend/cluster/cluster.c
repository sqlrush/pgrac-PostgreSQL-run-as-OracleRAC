 * cluster.c
 *	  pgrac cluster subsystem top-level entry (stage 0.2 stub).
 *
 *	  This file is the umbrella entry point for the pgrac cluster
 *	  subsystem.  In stage 0.2 it only provides stub functions to
 *	  validate the build-system integration; real cluster logic
 *	  (GRD bootstrap, background process spawning, shared memory
 *	  layout, etc.) lands in later feature points.
 *
 *	  See:
 *	    docs/development-roadmap.md     - 6-stage roadmap
 *	    docs/background-process-design.md - process layout
 *	    specs/spec-0.2-cluster-skeleton.md - this stage's spec

 * NOTES
 *	  This is a pgrac-original file (no derivation from PostgreSQL).
 *	  All exported symbols use the cluster_ or pgrac_ prefix.
 *
 *	  Stage 0.2 deliberately keeps this file minimal: the goal is to
 *	  validate that the new src/backend/cluster/ subtree wires into
 *	  PG's build system correctly, without introducing any cluster
 *	  behavior at runtime.  None of these functions are called from
 *	  postmaster yet (that wiring is stage 0.3).

/*
 * cluster_init -- Initialize the pgrac cluster subsystem.
 *
 *	Stub implementation for stage 0.2.  Logs at DEBUG1 and returns;

 *
 *	Real initialization lands in stage 0.3+ when this function is

 * NOTES
 *	This function MUST stay safe to call multiple times in stage 0.2,
 *	even though it is not actually invoked.  Future implementations
 *	will need to track an initialized flag to remain idempotent.
