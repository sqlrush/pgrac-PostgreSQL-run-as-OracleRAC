# Cluster wait events

linkdb registers 46 cluster-specific wait events distributed across
10 classes.  Each row in `pg_stat_cluster_wait_events` corresponds
to one entry in this table.

The values appear in the standard `pg_stat_activity.wait_event_type`
and `pg_stat_activity.wait_event` columns when a backend is waiting
on a cluster operation.

In the current release most events are registered but not yet
emitted by code (because the corresponding cross-node subsystems
are not yet implemented; cross-node sends raise
`ERRCODE_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` rather than blocking on a wait).
The events become observable as the corresponding subsystem ships.

## Querying

```sql
-- Total registered (46):
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_cluster_wait_events;

-- Per-class counts:
SELECT type, count(*)
  FROM pg_stat_cluster_wait_events
 GROUP BY type ORDER BY type;

-- Find an event by name:
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_cluster_wait_events
 WHERE name = 'PcmBlockReadNS';

-- Currently-active waits (joins with pg_stat_activity):
SELECT pid, wait_event_type, wait_event, query
  FROM pg_stat_activity
 WHERE wait_event_type LIKE 'Cluster:%';
```
