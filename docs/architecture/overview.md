# Architecture overview

linkdb extends PostgreSQL 16.13 with a cluster subsystem that
targets shared-disk multi-node deployment patterns (akin to Oracle
Real Application Clusters).  This document gives a 30,000-foot
view of the components present today and the boundary between
cluster code and stock PostgreSQL.

## Modules at a glance

| Module | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cluster` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster.c` | Top-level entry point (init / shutdown stubs) |
| `cluster_guc` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_guc.c` | Registers `cluster.*` GUCs (node_id / interconnect_tier / config_file) |
| `cluster_shmem` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_shmem.c` | Cluster shared-memory control block + per-subsystem allocators |
| `cluster_ic` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_ic.c` | Inter-node IPC abstraction (byte-stream + protocol layers; vtable per tier) |
| `cluster_conf` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_conf.c` | Parses `pgrac.conf` into the topology shmem region |
| `cluster_signal` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_signal.c` | Cluster ProcSignal handlers (extends PG SIGUSR1 multiplexer) |
| `cluster_views` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_views.c` | Set-returning functions backing the three cluster system views |
| `cluster_elog` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_elog.c` | `CLUSTER_LOG()` macro and the `cluster_phase` lifecycle marker |
| `cluster_smgr` | `src/backend/cluster/storage/cluster_smgr.c` | Cluster-aware storage manager.  Becomes a second `smgrsw[]` entry when `cluster.smgr_user_relations = on`;permanent user relations route through this path so two cluster instances can each open the same relation concurrently. |
| `cluster_shared_fs` | `src/backend/cluster/storage/cluster_shared_fs.c` | Per-cluster shared filesystem backend pluggable behind `cluster_smgr` (currently `local` only). |
| `cluster_qvotec` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_qvotec.c` | Quorum voting coordinator background process.  Polls voting disks, computes the cluster majority view, and signals backends to fail closed when quorum is lost.  Catalog surface (GUCs / views / wait events) currently active; the runtime spawn integration is held in a follow-up release. |
| `cluster_voting_disk_io` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_voting_disk_io.c` | Voting-disk slot read / write primitives: `O_DIRECT` best-effort with `O_SYNC` fallback, generation-and-CRC32C torn-write detection.  Used by the coordinator. |
| `cluster_quorum_decision` | `src/backend/cluster/cluster_quorum_decision.c` | Pure-function majority math + cross-instance node-id collision detection over the slot matrix observed by `cluster_qvotec`. |

## Quorum coordination

The cluster operates in fail-closed mode: writes are permitted only
while a healthy majority of voting disks confirm membership.  The
voting disks are pre-allocated files on shared storage configured via
`cluster.voting_disks`; each instance owns a 512-byte slot indexed by
its `node_id`.

Every `cluster.quorum_poll_interval_ms`, the coordinator (a) writes its
own slot with current heartbeat / epoch / incarnation, then (b) reads
every disk and combines the slot matrix into a `ClusterQuorumView`
(alive bitmap, max observed epoch, collision report).  Backends use a
lease window of `2 ×` the poll interval to gate write transactions:
on `COMMIT`, a backend that finds the lease expired or the view marked
not-OK aborts with `SQLSTATE 53R40` (`ERRCODE_CLUSTER_QUORUM_LOST`).

If a stale instance restarts with the same `node_id` as a peer that is
already serving, the newer instance fails fatal at first poll
(SQLSTATE `53R43`) so the older serving instance keeps the slot.

The `pg_cluster_quorum_state` and `pg_cluster_voting_disks` views
expose the current state.  See [system-views.md](../reference/system-views.md)
for column reference.

> **Status.** The catalog surface ships in this release; the
> coordinator's postmaster spawn integration is held in a follow-up
> release.  Until then, `pg_cluster_quorum_state.in_quorum` reports the
> fail-closed default.

## In-flight transaction management on quorum loss

When the cluster transitions from healthy to lost-quorum, two
independent defenses fire to protect data integrity:

1. **Commit-boundary fail-closed gate** (always-on).  Every
   `CommitTransaction` call consults the lease-aware
   `cluster_qvotec_in_quorum()` predicate;a `false` return raises
   `ERRCODE_CLUSTER_QUORUM_LOST` (SQLSTATE `53R40`).  No transaction
   that survives the lease window can commit through a quorum loss.

2. **In-flight `PROCSIG_CLUSTER_FREEZE_WRITES` broadcast.** The cluster
   coordinator (LMON) immediately signals every live backend; the next
   `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS` after the signal raises
   `ERRCODE_CLUSTER_QUORUM_LOST_BACKEND` (SQLSTATE `53R50`) and rolls
   back the transaction, even if it has not yet reached its commit
   boundary.  Long-running queries are aborted within milliseconds
   instead of seconds, removing wasted work and locks.

If the quorum loss persists for `cluster.self_fence_grace_ms` (default
30 s), the postmaster initiates a fast shutdown via SIGINT.  Backends
receive SIGTERM, dirty buffers flush, and recovery resumes from the
voting-disk slot on the next start.  This is a defense-in-depth
backstop — the commit gate already prevents incorrect commits — but
it removes inconsistent state from the cluster within a bounded
window.

The `pg_cluster_fence_state` view exposes per-backend signal counters,
broadcast timestamps, and the self-fence-pending state.  The
behaviour is governed by four PGC_POSTMASTER GUCs:
`cluster.self_fence_enabled` / `cluster.self_fence_grace_ms` /
`cluster.freeze_writes_enabled` / `cluster.fence_audit_log` (see
[configuration.md](../user-guide/configuration.md) for full reference).

> **Status.** The fence-lite path ships with the catalog surface,
> unit coverage for the signal/self-fence contracts, and 2-node
> steady-state TAP coverage.  End-to-end freeze/thaw broadcast TAP
> is deferred until the voting-disk I/O failure injection harness
> exists.  External fence command integration (IPMI / STONITH /
> cloud API) is not in scope and will land in a future watchdog spec.

## Reconfig coordinator

When the cluster sub-system service `cssd` (cluster synchronization
service) detects that a peer has stopped sending heartbeats for longer
than the deadband window, the surviving nodes run a deterministic
reconfig coordinator:

1. Every surviving node's `lmon` (lock monitor) reads the current peer
   liveness state from `cssd` once per tick.
2. The set of declared peers (excluding the dead set and any local
   node that has lost quorum) is the **survivor set**.
3. The lowest `node_id` in the survivor set is the **coordinator**.
   Every surviving node computes the same coordinator independently —
   there is no leader election round-trip.
4. Every surviving in-quorum node broadcasts
   `PROCSIG_CLUSTER_RECONFIG_START` to its own local backends.
   Backends notice this at the next `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS` and
   abort any in-flight writable transaction with SQLSTATE `53R60`
   (`ERRCODE_CLUSTER_RECONFIG_IN_PROGRESS`).  Read-only transactions
   absorb silently.
5. Only the coordinator advances the cluster membership epoch.  The
   new epoch is carried on the next outbound `cluster_ic` envelope
   from each node;peers observe and converge via Lamport piggyback.
6. `pg_cluster_reconfig_state` records the applied event:  event id,
   coordinator node id, old/new epoch, dead bitmap, applied timestamp,
   observer role (coordinator / survivor / none) and a snapshot of the
   `cssd` dead-generation counter that disambiguates a rejoin-then-
   redeath from a single sustained outage.

```
peer dies
  |
  +- cssd deadband on every surviving node
  |     |
  |     +- pg_cluster_cssd_peers shows peer state = suspected → dead
  |
  +- lmon tick on every in-quorum survivor
        |
        +- compute survivor set + coordinator (deterministic)
        |
        +- broadcast PROCSIG_CLUSTER_RECONFIG_START to local backends
        |     |
        |     +- backend ProcessInterrupts:
        |           writable tx → ERROR (53R60) → rollback + retry safe
        |           read-only / idle → absorb
        |
        +- if self == coordinator: epoch ++ + record event
        +- else                 : record observer event (no epoch++)
```

The retry path is deliberately fast.  Clients that observe `53R60`
should retry the transaction immediately;the next attempt runs under
the new membership epoch.  The coordinator broadcast and per-node
`PROCSIG` delivery typically complete in a single LMON tick (default
100 ms), so the visible downtime for a writable client is bounded by
the cssd deadband plus one tick.

> **Status.** Reconfig coordinator A-scope (internal-only) ships with
> a single-tick deterministic-coordinator design, no phase machine,
> no voting-disk persistence of reconfig events, and no peer-fence
> actor.  The fail-closed authority remains
> `cluster_qvotec_in_quorum()` + the spec-2.28 freeze gate + the
> commit gate;the reconfig coordinator only advances the epoch and
> wakes backends — it does not itself prevent a write.  Larger

> event log, dynamic election) are future spec work.

## Postmaster startup flow

```
postmaster main
  |
  +- ProcessConfigFile (postgresql.conf)
  |     |
  |     +- cluster.* GUCs registered via cluster_init_guc
  |        (process_shared_preload_libraries phase)
  |
  +- CreateSharedMemoryAndSemaphores
        |
        +- cluster_init_shmem
              |
              +- cluster_ctl_shmem_init      (allocate cluster control block)
              +- cluster_conf_shmem_init     (allocate topology shmem)
              +- cluster_conf_load           (parse pgrac.conf or fall back single-node)
              +- cluster_ic_init             (bind interconnect vtable based on tier GUC)
```

## Build modes

| Build flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--enable-cluster` | Cluster subsystem active.  All cluster GUCs / views / SRFs present.  `cluster_*.o` objects linked into `postgres`. |
| `--disable-cluster` (default) | Cluster subsystem absent.  Cluster GUCs not recognised.  Cluster system views return zero rows.  `postgres` binary is symbol-equivalent to upstream PostgreSQL 16.13 (no `cluster_init` / `cluster_shutdown` / `pgrac_version_string` symbols). |

The `--disable-cluster` mode is useful when running linkdb as a
drop-in PostgreSQL replacement without enabling cluster features —
e.g. on a standalone development machine.

## Interconnect tiers

The `cluster_ic` module defines four tier slots.  The first two are
populated in the current release.

| Tier | Status |
|---|---|
| `stub` | **Active** — same-node ops are no-ops, cross-node ops raise `ERRCODE_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` |
| `tier1` | **Active** — TCP transport carrying the LMON aux-process heartbeat between every pair of nodes declared in `pgrac.conf`.  Per-peer state is exposed via [`pg_cluster_ic_peers`](../reference/system-views.md#pg_cluster_ic_peers). |
| `tier2` | Not supported |
| `tier3` | Not supported |

Switching tiers is controlled via the `cluster.interconnect_tier`
GUC.  See [Configuration](../user-guide/configuration.md) for
runtime details.

## Storage manager dispatch

linkdb extends PostgreSQL's `smgrsw[]` array from one to two
entries when built with `--enable-cluster`.  The first entry is
PostgreSQL's stock `md.c`;the second is `cluster_smgr`, a
cluster-aware storage manager that bridges into the
`cluster_shared_fs` vtable.

| smgr_which | Owner | Used when |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | `md.c` (stock PG) | Temporary relations always; permanent relations whenever `cluster.smgr_user_relations = off` (the default) or `cluster.shared_storage_backend = stub`. |
| `1` | `cluster_smgr` | Permanent relations only, and only when both `cluster.shared_storage_backend != stub` AND `cluster.smgr_user_relations = on`.  Two cluster instances may have a backend each open the same relation concurrently;each instance keeps process-local SMgrRelation state and process-local file handles. |

Cache invalidation across cluster instances is wired through three
hook points (relation, relation map, and unlink-pending) that
fire from the corresponding PostgreSQL invalidation paths.  The
hook bodies bump a single counter — visible via
`pg_stat_cluster_counters` under
`cluster.smgr.remote_invalidation_stub_call_count` — and the
unlink-pending hook additionally closes the per-process file
handle for the unlinked relation.  Cross-instance signal
propagation is not yet activated;peer instances may briefly
observe stale cached state until invalidation completes
through PostgreSQL's regular sinval queue.

The `cluster.smgr_user_relations` GUC is **experimental**;
enabling it raises a postmaster startup `WARNING` and is
unsuitable for production workloads.  See
[Configuration](../user-guide/configuration.md#clustersmgr_user_relations).

## Message envelope

Every message that crosses the interconnect — regardless of which
tier carries it — is framed by a fixed 36-byte little-endian header
(the *cluster interconnect envelope*) followed by a
per-message-type payload.  The envelope carries the wire-protocol
version, message type identifier, sender / destination node IDs,
payload length, and a CRC covering the whole frame.  All multi-byte
fields are 4-byte aligned.

Each message type is registered once at postmaster startup with a
stable numeric identifier (`msg_type`), a name, and metadata
describing which backend types are allowed to produce it and
whether it may be broadcast.  The runtime catalogue is exposed via
[`pg_cluster_ic_msg_types`](../reference/system-views.md#pg_cluster_ic_msg_types).
The current release registers one type:

| `msg_type` | Name | Producer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | `heartbeat` | LMON aux process | Point-to-point liveness probe; no payload other than the envelope itself. |

Adding a new interconnect message type therefore means: pick the
next free `msg_type`, register it during postmaster startup with
its allowed producer set + handler, and define the payload layout.
The wire envelope itself stays unchanged.

## Membership epoch and SCN piggyback

Every envelope carries two cross-cutting fields beyond its message
identification:

- **Membership epoch** is a node-local monotonic counter incremented
  whenever the cluster's membership changes (a peer joins or leaves).
  The receiver rejects any envelope whose carried epoch does not
  match the local current epoch — pre-reconfig in-flight frames are
  dropped on the recv path with a logged message and a per-peer
  `stale_epoch_drop_count` increment.  No frame is acted upon during
  a membership transition, so post-reconfig state is never
  contaminated by stale traffic.
- **SCN piggyback** (Lamport-style) lets every received envelope
  advance the local SCN clock if the carried SCN is greater than the
  current local value.  Verification happens *before* the advance, so
  forged or stale-epoch frames cannot push the SCN forward.

## Large payloads and framing

The 36-byte envelope caps a single message frame at 16 MB of payload.
When a sender needs to deliver a larger payload it uses the chunked
framing layer, which splits the buffer into N consecutive frames
each carrying a 16-byte chunk header that records `chunk_seq`,
`chunk_total`, the original `total_payload_len`, and the wrapped
inner `msg_type`.  The receiver assembles the chunks into a per-peer
dedicated memory context; on completion the inner message is
dispatched as if it had arrived in a single frame.  If a peer falls
silent partway through a reassembly, the receiver times out (10 s
by default), logs the event, and drops the connection rather than
holding the half-built buffer.  The default upper bound on a chunked
payload is 64 MB, configurable up to a 256 MB hard cap via
`cluster.interconnect_payload_max_bytes`.

## Liveness — application heartbeat plus TCP keepalive

Liveness is enforced on two layers.  The primary path is an
application-level heartbeat that LMON sends at a configurable
interval (default 1 s).  Three missed acks mark the peer down and
trigger reconnection — typically within ~3 s of a real failure.
Beneath that the kernel applies TCP keepalive probes, configured
via `cluster.interconnect_tcp_keepidle_sec` /
`_tcp_keepintvl_sec` / `_tcp_keepcnt`.  This is a fallback for the
rare case where the application path stalls but the socket stays
open; with the defaults the kernel needs at most 120 s to declare
the connection dead.

## Topology

The cluster topology — list of nodes plus their addresses — is
declared in a single file (`pgrac.conf`) loaded at postmaster
startup.  The parsed result lives in shared memory so every backend
sees an identical view.  Updates require a restart in the current
release.

See [Configuration](../user-guide/configuration.md) for the
`pgrac.conf` format and [System views](../reference/system-views.md)
for the `pg_cluster_nodes` runtime projection.

## What's not in the picture yet

Several subsystems referenced in the wait event registry
(see [Wait events](../reference/wait-events.md)) are scaffolded
but not active in the current release.  Operations they would
serve return `ERRCODE_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` rather than blocking
on a wait.

| Subsystem | Status |
|---|---|
| GES (distributed lock manager) | Not active |
| PCM (parallel cache management) | Not active |
| Cache Fusion (cross-node block transfer) | Not active |
| SCN propagation | Not active |
| Reconfiguration / Heartbeat | Not active |
| Cluster-aware recovery | Not active |
| Cross-node sinval | Not active |
| Cross-node undo | Not active |
| Active Data Guard | Not active |
